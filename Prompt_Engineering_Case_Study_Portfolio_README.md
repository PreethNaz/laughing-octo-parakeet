## 📂 Case Study 1: Simplifying Complex Technical Documentation into Plain English

### 🧩 Context
As a technical writer, I explored how prompt engineering can simplify specialized scientific content for non-technical users. This use case demonstrates how AI can rewrite mass spectrometer documentation in layman's terms.

### ⚙️ Task
Rewrite a dense technical explanation using a friendly, easy-to-understand tone without losing essential meaning.

### 📝 Original Technical Text
> “The system utilizes electrospray ionization (ESI) to transfer ions from the liquid phase into the gas phase. Ionized analytes are directed into the quadrupole for mass filtering prior to entering the collision cell, where fragmentation occurs to support compound identification in MS/MS analysis mode.”

---

### 🔴 Before Prompt Tuning
**Prompt:**  
`Summarize this technical paragraph.`

**Output:**  
> “The system uses electrospray ionization to transfer ions into the gas phase and sends them through a quadrupole for mass filtering. Then they go to a collision cell for fragmentation and identification in MS/MS mode.”

**Issues:**  
- Uses technical jargon  
- Literal and not user-friendly  
- Not helpful for lay users

---

### 🟢 After Prompt Tuning
**Prompt:**  
`Rewrite this technical explanation in simple terms so a non-technical user can understand what the mass spectrometer does, using a friendly and clear tone. Avoid jargon unless absolutely necessary, and explain any technical terms briefly.`

**Output:**  
> “The system turns tiny particles in a liquid into gas so they can be studied. It first filters the particles based on their weight, then breaks them into smaller pieces to help identify what they are made of. This helps scientists understand the sample more clearly.”

**Improvements:**  
- Simple and clear language  
- Step-by-step logic  
- Preserved core meaning  
- Better user engagement

### 🧠 Reflection
This tuning task closely mirrors my work as a technical writer—translating complex content for broader audiences. Prompt tuning allows me to achieve similar clarity and usability using generative AI.

## 📂 Case Study 2: Generating FAQs from Technical Documentation

### 🧩 Context
Generating clear FAQs from installation guides helps users troubleshoot quickly and improves self-service support. I used prompt engineering to automate this task effectively.

### ⚙️ Task
Create 3 FAQs from a product installation guide, focusing on the needs of a first-time user.

### 📝 Original Text
> “Before starting the installation, ensure that the system is powered off and all cables are disconnected. The installation area must be free of dust, moisture, and direct sunlight. Use an antistatic wrist strap during the procedure. Connect the device using the provided power adapter and check for the green LED light to confirm successful installation.”

---

### 🔴 Before Prompt Tuning
**Prompt:**  
`Create an FAQ from this paragraph.`

**Output:**  
> Q: What is the installation process?  
> A: Follow all the installation steps as described.

**Issues:**  
- Too generic  
- Poor structure  
- Not helpful to users

---

### 🟢 After Prompt Tuning
**Prompt:**  
`Extract 3 FAQs from the following installation guide paragraph. Frame the questions from the perspective of a first-time user and ensure the answers are concise, helpful, and avoid unnecessary jargon.`

**Output:**  
> **Q1:** What should I do before starting the installation?  
> **A1:** Make sure the system is powered off and all cables are disconnected.  
>
> **Q2:** What conditions are needed for a safe installation area?  
> **A2:** The area should be clean, dry, and not exposed to direct sunlight.  
>
> **Q3:** How do I know the device is installed correctly?  
> **A3:** Connect the power adapter and check for a green LED light.

**Improvements:**  
- Practical and user-centered questions  
- Clear, informative answers  
- Real-world usability

### 🧠 Reflection
This example shows the importance of specifying tone, user context, and output structure in prompt design. The result is useful content aligned with user support needs—just like what I did in my technical writing role.
